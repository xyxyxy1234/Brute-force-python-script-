This is a simple python file which breaks the password of a zip-file using brute-forcing. It utilizes a dictionary file which it then matches with the original password of the file
and breaks the password, which it then saves with a different name. This is a universal script, meaning it can work with any kind of dictionary file provided to it,in this case it 
is the infamous rockyou.txt, but one thing should be kept in mind that both the dictionary file and the zip file should both be in the same location
